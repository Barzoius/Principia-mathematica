The Gauss-Jordan method is similar to the Gaussian elimination process,

except that the entries both above and below each pivot are zeroed out. 

After performing Gaussian elimination on a matrix, the result is in row echelon form, 

while the result after the Gauss-Jordan method is in reduced row echelon form.
